### Overview
We propose a **D**ual-level **N**oise **A**ugmentation for **G**raph **C**lustering with Triplet-wise Contrastive Learning (**DNA-GC**), which  mainly consists of **H**ybrid **N**oise **R**epresentation **A**ugmentation (**HNRA**) and **N**oise-**A**ware **T**riple **C**ontrastive **L**earning (**NATCL**) modules. The overall framework of DNA-GC is illustrated in Fig. 1.
